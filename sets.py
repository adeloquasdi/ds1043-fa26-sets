# We've used dictionaries already, but we haven't discussed sets. You can think
# of sets as a dictionary that only has keys, no values. Why would we do this?

# Let's do an experiment. Read the following function to get an idea of what we're
# testing. Then run it a few times to see what the results are. Finally, set a
# breakpoint at the point indicated and hit 'debug' to take a look at our haystacks.
# Do this by clicking the line number of the specified line in PyCharm and clicking
# the green "bug" icon.

# A classic application of dictionaries is as a store of previously completed work.
# This is exceptionally helpful when computation is costly (either directly or
# because it requires a slow resource, like a network request) or repetitive.

# An toy example of repetitive computation is a recursive implementation of
# calculating a given Fibonacci number:
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    "Calculate the n-th member of the Fibonacci Sequence"
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("The Fibonacci Sequence is not defined for n < 0")
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)

# Rewrite this function to use a dictionary to cache repetitive work
def memo_fib(n: int, memo: dict) -> int:
    "Calculate the n-th member of the Fibonacci Sequence, but save work using a dictionary"
    return fib(n)

# Run an experiment using the debugger to compare the stack usage of the basic
# recursive version with your version that uses a dictionary. Set a breakpoint on
# the first line of the function and watch the stack view on the left side of the
# debugger tool window as you step through the execution of the function.

# You will want to modify the if name main block to run `fib` and `memo_fib` for debugging
